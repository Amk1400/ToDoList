TODO:
class EntityModifyMenu inherits from basemenu
and is parent of projectmodifymenu and taskmodifymenu

some methods are implemented here:
edit entity
delete entity

which are used in subclasses of thisclass
its better to implement here and avoid overriding as posssible

when i choose sow&modify for projects or task
firstly it should represent which entity is being modified
then it shpuld ask what modify do u want to apply?
edit or delete or back?
